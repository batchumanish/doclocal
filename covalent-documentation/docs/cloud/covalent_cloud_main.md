# Covalent Cloud

Welcome to the documentation for Covalent Cloud, the managed version of the powerful Covalent open-source orchestration platform. Covalent Cloud is designed to make your advanced computing tasks even more seamless and straightforward by abstracting away the complexities of cloud computing, letting you focus on your work and innovation. While Covalent already provides an abstraction layer for cloud providers, users are still required to have a basic understanding of various cloud services and cloud tools like terraform, cloud storage setup etc. Covalent Cloud takes this abstraction a step further by removing the need for users to be familiar with the intricacies of these technologies. With Covalent Cloud, you can concentrate on your workloads, algorithms, and research without worrying about the underlying compute.

## Covalent Cloud vs. Open Source

Covalent Cloud enhances the Covalent open-source experience by incorporating features such as Single Sign-On (SSO), multi-tenancy, security, tenant isolation, and a richer, collaborative UI. Covalent operates on three primary levels - client, administration, and compute - and Covalent Cloud significantly elevates the client experience by supporting teams and organizations in addition to individual users, for whom the open-source version is designed.

In terms of administration, Covalent Cloud truly excels. While the open-source version empowers individual users to scale their extensive workflows without restrictions, Covalent Cloud emphasizes the importance of administration, security, and collaboration. Key features include SSO, multi-tenancy, and robust security measures. Covalent Cloud also introduces the concept of shared files and environments, enabling team members and organizations to share the resources and assets required for computation.

As for the compute aspect, Covalent Cloud goes beyond the open-source offering by adding a new layer of abstraction on top of the major compute paradigms along with fault tolerance. This layer removes the need for users to understand the intricate details of the underlying cloud infrastructure and focuses solely on the necessary compute resources, such as the number of CPUs, GPUs, and memory. By highlighting these differences, users can quickly grasp the value proposition of Covalent Cloud and appreciate its advantages over the open-source alternative.
