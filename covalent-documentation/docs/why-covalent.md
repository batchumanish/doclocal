    <td>Parallel computation speeds execution, but requires careful attention to data relationships.</td>
    <td>Tracking, repeating, and sharing results.</td>

With Covalent, you:

- Assign functions to appropriate resources: Use advanced hardware (quantum computers, HPC clusters) for the heavy lifting and commodity hardware for bookkeeping.
- Test functions on local servers before shipping them to advanced hardware.
- Let Covalent’s services analyze functions for data independence and automatically parallelize them.
- Run experiments from a Jupyter notebook (or whatever your preferred interactive Python environment is).
- Track workflows and examine results in a browser-based GUI.
