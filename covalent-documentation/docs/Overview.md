### Where Covalent Shines

Covalent distinguishes itself in several key areas:

- **Heterogeneous System Support**: Manages a diverse range of systems, including classical HPC, quantum systems, and AI/ML workloads.
- **Ease of Scaling**: Enables users to scale local prototypes to distributed applications in hybrid or multi-cloud configurations.
- **Cloud Abstraction**: Abstracts complexities of different cloud providers and on-premises HPC solutions, allowing users to focus on their tasks.
- **Backend Agnostic**: Supports various cloud-based/on-prem quantum/classical computing backends on major platforms.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Fosters collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement, inviting worldwide contributions.

### What Covalent is Not

- **A Quantum Hardware Provider**: Covalent does not provide its own quantum hardware.
- **A Standalone Quantum/AI/ML Framework**: Covalent is an orchestration platform that enables seamless integration of AI/ML workloads into advanced computing workflows.
- **Limited to Pre-built Algorithms**: Covalent allows users to integrate custom algorithms and workflows, enabling innovative solutions for specific problems.

By simplifying the orchestration of advanced computing resources, Covalent enables researchers and developers to focus on innovation, driving the progress in various domains. The platform's open-source foundation also helps democratize quantum computing by breaking down entry barriers and fostering global collaboration.
