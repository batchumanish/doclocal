  "description": "The Covalent server runs as a service on your local machine or on a server. The service contains a dispatcher that analyzes workflows (lattices) and hands its component functions (electrons) off to executors. Each executor is an adaptor to a backend hardware resource. Covalent has a growing list of turn-key executors for common compute backends. If no executor exists yet for your compute platform, Covalent provides base classes for writing your own.",
