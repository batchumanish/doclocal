  "description": "The Covalent SDK exists to enable compute-intensive workloads, such as ML training and testing, to run as server-managed workflows. To accomplish this, the workload is broken down into tasks that are arranged in a workflow. The tasks and the workflow are Python functions decorated with Covalentâ€™s electron and lattice interfaces, respectively.",
