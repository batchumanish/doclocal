# Result-Dependent if/else <Goto link="https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/blob/develop/doc/source/developer/patterns/result_dependent_if_else.ipynb" />

To branch based on the result from an electron, put the branch (if/else) logic inside another electron.

## Context

Often the output of one task is a value used to choose the execution path. In these cases, perform the if/else logic inside an electron.

When a lattice is dispatched, the Covalent server executes the lattice in order to build the transport graph. The transport graph is then analyzed to parallelize electron execution on their assigned executors.

If the server encounters a branch decision based on the output of an electron, it cannot infer the structure on which the decision depends and is prevented from building the transport graph.

## Best Practice

Compute branching inside an electron. Electronsâ€™ execution is deferred during the graph build phase, so their output cannot be used to build the transport graph and analyze the execution for parallelization. Instead, the electron is added to the transport graph and the branching is computed within the electron when it is executed.

For result-dependent computations that might be too complex to encapsulate in a single electron, use a [sublattice](/docs/user-documentation/covalent-patterns/dynamic-workflows).

## Example

Contrast the two examples below.

### Example 1: Incorrect 

This example demonstrates the incorrect approach: choosing the execution path in the lattice based on the output of `task_1`.

```py
import covalent as ct

# Technique 1: Incorrect

@ct.electron
def task_1(x):
    return x * 2

@ct.electron
def task_2(x):
    return x ** 3

@ct.lattice
def workflow(a):

    res_1 = task_1(a)

    if res_1 == 10:
        final_res = task_2(res_1)
    else:
        final_res = res_1

    return final_res

id = ct.dispatch(workflow)(5)
res = ct.get_result(id, wait=True)
print(res)
```

```

### Example 2: Improved
The output of `task_1` is passed to the `task_2_new`, which executes the chosen path internally and returns the result.

```py
import covalent as ct

# Technique 2: Correct

@ct.electron
def task_1(x):
    return x * 2

# Method (2):
@ct.electron
def task_2_new(x):
    if x == 10:
        return x ** 3
    else:
        return x

@ct.lattice
def workflow_2(a):
    res_1 = task_1(a)
    return task_2_new(res_1)

id = ct.dispatch(workflow_2)(5)
res = ct.get_result(id, wait=True)
print(res)
```

```
