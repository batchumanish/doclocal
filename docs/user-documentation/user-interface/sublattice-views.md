When the [Graph View](/docs/user-documentation/user-interface/graph-view) screen displays a dispatch containing one or more sublattices, the screen has variations that enable you to view details of the sublattices.

The page still has three display areas, but their features vary:

[**Transport Graph**](/docs/user-documentation/user-interface/sublattices-transport-graph)
<div style={{marginTop:'-17px',marginBottom:'10px'}}>
Shows the Transport Graph of the dispatch. Sublattices are shown as single nodes.
</div>

[**Lattice Sidebar**](/docs/user-documentation/user-interface/sublattices-sidebar)
<div style={{marginTop:'-17px',marginBottom:'10px'}}>
Offers a Sublattice tab in which you can select a sublattice to view its internal transport graph.
</div>


[**Electron Sidebar**](/docs/user-documentation/user-interface/electron-subsidebar)
<div style={{marginTop:'-17px',marginBottom:'10px'}}>
Treats a sublattice node as an electron, showing information about the sublattice as a whole.
</div>
