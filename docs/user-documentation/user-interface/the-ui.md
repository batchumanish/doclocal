This User Interface Reference describes the functionality available in the Covalent GUI, organized by screen.

For help performing specific tasks using the Covalent GUI, refer to the [How-to Guide](/docs/user-documentation/how-to/how-to-guide).

The following screens are available in the Covalent GUI:

**[Dashboard](/docs/user-documentation/user-interface/dashboard)**
 <div style={{marginTop:'-17px',marginBottom:'10px'}}>
Displays a list of workflows that have been dispatched to the server. The dispatches are summarized at the top of the screen. The Dashboard is the default screen in the Covalent GUI.
</div> 


**[Graph View](/docs/user-documentation/user-interface/graph-view)**
<div style={{marginTop:'-17px',marginBottom:'10px'}}>
Displays details of a selected dispatch. Click a dispatch ID on the Dashboard to see the Graph View for that dispatch.
</div> 


**[Sublattice Views](/docs/user-documentation/user-interface/sublattice-views)**
 <div style={{marginTop:'-17px',marginBottom:'10px'}}>
When you open the page for a lattice that contains sublattices, controls in the Graph View include extra options to view details of the sublattices.
</div> 


**[Lattice Graph Preview](/docs/user-documentation/user-interface/preview-transport-graph)**
 <div style={{marginTop:'-17px',marginBottom:'10px'}}>

 <div style={{marginTop:'-17px',marginBottom:'10px'}}>

</div>
