<h1>What is Covalent?</h1>

Covalent is an open-source advanced computing orchestration platform, designed to address the unique challenges of integrating classical, quantum, and AI/ML resources in high-performance computing (HPC) workflows. In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and quantum computing, there is a growing need for orchestration tools that can manage these heterogeneous systems. Covalent provides a solution that simplifies the orchestration of advanced computing resources, ensuring seamless communication and resource management between classical HPC, quantum systems, and AI/ML workloads in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and beyond.

Efficient orchestration and resource management are crucial for unlocking the full potential of advanced computing across a wide range of applications, as the field of quantum computing advances and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms gain traction. At the same time, AI and ML workloads demand significant computational power from CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs for training, further highlighting the need for an orchestration platform that can manage these diverse systems. Covalent is designed to address the paradigm shift required to tackle various challenges in this space, including heterogeneity at multiple levels, integration of HPC and quantum computing, harmonization between tools and software, and bridging domain expertise gaps.

## Key Features

**Hybrid Algorithms and Resource Collaboration**: Covalent simplifies the management of advanced computing experiments by enabling a symbiotic relationship between classical HPC, quantum computing resources, and AI/ML workloads. This collaboration allows for more efficient and accurate solutions for complex problems in areas such as cryptography, optimization, materials science, and machine learning.

**Workflow Orchestration**: Covalent focuses on rapid iteration, distributed computation, and experiment management. It functions at the "distributed workflow" layer, enabling users to efficiently design and distribute workflows and instantly reproduce and scale quantum experiments.

**Scalability**: Users can easily scale up their local prototype running on a laptop to a distributed application running in a hybrid or multi-cloud configuration with just a few code changes. Covalent supports various cloud-based/on-prem quantum/classical computing backends on major platforms, allowing users to flexibly deploy their code to the most available and cost-effective quantum resources, regardless of their location.

**Open-Source Collaboration**: Covalent's open-source foundation fosters collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement, inviting developers and researchers worldwide to contribute their knowledge and nurture diverse perspectives and ideas. This collaborative approach helps break down entry barriers and democratize quantum computing.
