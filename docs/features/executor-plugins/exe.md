# Plugins

Covalent offers various plugins, starting with executor plugins. Executors are used to run tasks on the various kinds of backends. Executors decouple a task from hardware details by executing the task in a certain place in a certain way. For example, the *local* executor invokes the task on the userâ€™s local computer. You can define custom executors to make Covalent compatible with any remote backend system. Covalent has a wide range of executor plugin libraries that connect to a variety of resources, from local Slurm clusters to cloud-based AWS, GCP, and Azure compute nodes and more.
